# 0x18-C Dynamic libraries

Dynamic libraries in C are pre-compiled modules of code that can be linked to a program at runtime. They provide a way to share and reuse code across multiple applications.

Dynamic libraries are separate files with a ".dll" extension on Windows or a ".so" extension on Unix-like systems. They contain compiled code that can be loaded into memory by a program when needed. By linking to a dynamic library, an executable can access the functions and data defined within it.

The advantages of using dynamic libraries include code modularity, reduced executable size, and the ability to update libraries independently of the main program. They also allow for dynamic loading and unloading of modules during runtime.
